# DHRH poster for the DARIAH Annual Event 2024

This work is part of the research work entitled "Pipelines, workflows, work packages: what's in a word: a reflection on metaphors used to design interdisciplinary projects in Digital Humanities" conducted by a team based at the Digital humanities Research Hub (DHRH), School of Advanced Study, University of London, including Kaspar Beelen, Kunika Kono, Caio Mello and Anna-Maria Sichani.

For the DARIAH Annual Event 2024 (June 18-21, 2024), we developed a questionnaire and digital poster to engage with the participants, and to gather and visualise community responses in situ.

The questionnaire aims to capture how the DH community is currently using available terms describing project design, implementation and planning in interdisciplinary Digital Humanities projects. Alongside these evidence-based findings, the team seeks to further assess differences among these concepts by focusing on aspects of interoperability, reproducibility, research planning and interdisciplinary collaboration among team members in DH projects.
